# Linux Ansible Playbook

A simple Ansible playbook for setting up `apt`-based Linux servers and virtual machines. This is not my personal development setup, but a stripped down version to make life more bearable. It includes

- Setting up a sensible SSH configuration and enable public key authentification
- Setting ZSH as default shell
- Setting up my [dotfiles](https://github.com/czengler/dotfiles-linux)
- Compiling neovim from source and installing it (Ubuntu and Debian have ancient versions included)
- Installing LF
- Setting up some minor networking tools and tweaks
